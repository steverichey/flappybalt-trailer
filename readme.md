# Flappybalt HD Ad

In the spirit of the original Flappybalt, this is the "source code" for the Flappybalt HD trailer.

# Building

To build the "titles", go to the title folder and run `lime test neko` from the command line, provided you have Haxe installed.

The trailer itself was created using Blender 2.7, open `Project.blend` and choose "Render Animation" to create it.

This is free, open-source software under the MIT license.
